<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Welcome to the Minetown’s whitelist
process. This is an automated process to gain whitelist (to be able
to build) in our server. To complete this, you must be ingame at the
same time, and enter your username at the bottom of this page to gain
a code to whitelist. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before you do however, please read the
warning below as it’s important as well as the server rules further
down which you agree to as part of the whitelist process.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This server operates Cheat detection
(including Flying and X-raying) as well grief control (including full
logging of block placement/removal and chest access). Any attempt to
cheat or grief will result in your actions being logged and a global
ban being issued.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This server operates as part of the
<B>MCBans Global Banlist</B> (link behind that) project therefore any
bans received on our server will go global on every server using
McBans (which is the large percentage). Therefore it is not worth
your time causing trouble here as we will damage your username. As
part of the process of McBans, you can appeal any ban however we will
take screenshots and download the log to guarantee we will always win
and your ban will stay.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By getting whitelist on our server, you
must accept the above. We will never penalize innocent players and
will accept genuine appeals on our website, but anyone who is out
there to cause trouble will damage their reputation across multiple
servers, as well as doing no damage to use (as we have a simple
rollback a user command available to undo your damage).</P>

require manual intervention between you and a member of staff to
discuss your whitelist.
