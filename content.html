	Welcome to the Minetown’s whitelist
	process. This is an automated process to gain whitelist (to be able
	to build) in our server. To complete this, you must be ingame at the
	same time, and enter your username at the bottom of this page to gain
	a code to whitelist.
</P>
<P>
	<BR>
</P>
<P>
	Before you do however, please read the
	warning below as it’s important as well as the server rules further
	down which you agree to as part of the whitelist process.

	This server operates Cheat detection
	(including Flying and X-raying) as well grief control (including full
	logging of block placement/removal and chest access). Any attempt to
	cheat or grief will result in your actions being logged and a global
	ban being issued.

<P>
	This server operates as part of the <B>MCBans Global Banlist</B> (link behind that) project therefore any
	bans received on our server will go global on every server using
	McBans (which is the large percentage). Therefore it is not worth
	your time causing trouble here as we will damage your username. As
	part of the process of McBans, you can appeal any ban however we will
	take screenshots and download the log to guarantee we will always win
	and your ban will stay.

	By getting whitelist on our server, you
	must accept the above. We will never penalize innocent players and
	will accept genuine appeals on our website, but anyone who is out
	there to cause trouble will damage their reputation across multiple
	servers, as well as doing no damage to use (as we have a simple
	rollback a user command available to undo your damage).

	discuss your whitelist.
